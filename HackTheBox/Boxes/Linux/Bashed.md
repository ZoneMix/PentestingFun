- once we have an actual shell, sudo -l to see we can run anything as scriptmanager
- sudo -u scriptmanager bash -i
- cd /scripts
- in this directory it is difficult to notice but there is test.py and test.txt that seems to run every minute, we see this by the time stamps on test.txt
- so just grab a python reverse shell on pentest monkey and upload to the server as test.py
- then get root shell after a minute
