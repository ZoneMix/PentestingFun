# Beep
- Running nmap we see that there is port 22,25,80,110,111,143,443,878,993,995,3306,4190,4445,4559,5038,10000
## First Way
- browsing to the ip we see that we come to an elastix webpage
- doing a gobuster we find there is an /admin page which brings us to a login for FreePBX
- we can also use searchsploit to search for elastix
- we see a local file inclusion
- under /help there we can see some config files for the box possibly to find versions
- there is a file path in the exploit that we can just paste in the bar and then look for passwords
- since it is local file inclusion we can also check /etc/passwd for users
- stripping the passwords from the other file amportal.conf we can use them to try and ssh into root
- luckily one of them works
- ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 root@10.10.10.7

## Second Way
