# Nibbles
- nmap shows port 22 and 80 open
- view source of page and run gobuster on /nibbleblog to find admin.php
- eventually you will find the /nibbleblog/content/private/users.xml to find admin is the login user
- out of random guessing the password is nibbles....
- once we get in there is a cve we can run in msfconsole to obtain a shell
- once we have nibbler run sudo -l and this may or may not work, just be patient
