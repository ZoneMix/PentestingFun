# Postman

## Nmap Scan
- Port 22,80,10000 open (mistake)
- Do full port scan to find redis port

## User
- We can connect to redis on port 6739, something like that, need redis-cli
- Within redis, we can find an exploit to put in an ssh key to gain the redis user
- We do need to change the directory to where the redis ssh keys are stored, and that should be in /var/somewhere
- Once we get foothold with the redis user, there is a bactkup of a private key within /tmp or /var, the private key is for the user matt within the /home directory
- We can use ssh2john to make the key a hash for john to crack
- Once we have the key, computer2008, we can go back to the redis user and su matt, and give the password.
- One thing I would like to try is to ssh into matt with the private key, I did not think about doing that, however we do need the password to get root

## Root
- Once we have foothold on matt, we can easily use another exploit within msfconsole or searchsploit to gain access to the root user
- We do have to have valid creds on the box, so we can use matt and computer2008
- We can then run the exploit and get a callback shell for root
