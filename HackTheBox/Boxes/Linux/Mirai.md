# Mirai
- nmap returns 22,53,80,1830,32400, and 32469
- doing a gobuster on the page allows us to find /admin
- we see it is a pihole interface
- so we must be hacking into a raspberry pi
- using default creds with ssh pi:raspberry we get in
- we can sudo su to gain root but root flag is on the usb stick
- luckily using df -h we see it is still mounted to /dev/sdb
- we can use strings on /dev/sdb to find the flag for root
