# Blocky
- nmap shows 21,22,80,25565 open
- it is a minecraft server ironically
- going onto the website shows a site under construction
- doing a gobuster shows us a db with phpmyadmin as well as a wordpress site
- there is also a plugin directory with files
- decompiling the jar files within the plugins we see the mysql database password for root
- we can log into phpmyadmin with the root/creds and find the users for the word press website
- this was simple because it was password reuse with the user notch
- we can ssh into notch run sudo -l and see we are a sudoer
- we just escalate to root and get into the box
