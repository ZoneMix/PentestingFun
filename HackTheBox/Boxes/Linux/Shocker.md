# Shocker
- nmap shows that port 80 and 2222 are open
- we browse to the page to find nothing really, so using dirbuster we find with recursive file finding user.sh, using the extension php,html,htm,sh,pl,py,cgi
- once we find that the box name gives away the exploit but we have to use shellshock
- within msfconsole, we can use multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
- setting up the options and giving it the target uri to /cgi-bin/user.sh we can get into the box
- next we do sudo -l and we are presented with running perl as a gtfo bin
- using sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh"' we get root
