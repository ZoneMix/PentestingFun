# Optimum

- Nmap shows that only port 80 is open
- There is the httpfileserver httpd 2.3 version on there to exploit
- Going to the website itself we see it is running rejetto, and luckily there is an exploit for it
- use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
- we pop a meterpreter shell
- running sysinfo we see it is a windows 2012 r2 server with x64 arch
- we are default in x32 reverse shell so it would be wise to take over another process, such as explorer.exe
- ps will show the processes available and their arch
- migrate <pid>
- local_exploit_suggester can be unreliable on x64 systems, so best bet is to try things in the exploit/windows/local
- from trial and error ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc works and we root the machine
