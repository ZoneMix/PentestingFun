# Grandpa
- nmap scan shows port 80 open with microsoft iis 6.0
- just searching microsoft iis 6.0 shows us the exploit to use within msfconsole
- iis webdav scstorage something
- once we have a shell on the box we see it is x86 as well so we can just use the local_exploit_suggester
- ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl will give us a root meterpreter session
- cat the files needed within documents and settings
