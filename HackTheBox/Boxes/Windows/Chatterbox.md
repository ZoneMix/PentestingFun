# Chatterbox
- nmap scan showed that the machine had an AChat server on a port in the 6000s

- using searchsploit, we find an exploit for the machine
- using a custom reverse shell payload with msfvenom, we get into the machine
- once on the machine, we can actually enter the administrator desktop meaning that some permissions may be flawed
- using icacls on the Desktop directory, we see we have full control meaning we can just change the file perms of root.txt
- using cacls we can change the perms of the machine
