# Json
- looking at the page on port 80 leads us to a login page
- using the default creds of admin:admin allows us to get into the admin interface
- looking through the source code, and the javascript files, we see that there is some custom js code, which reveals the directory of /api/account
- going to that does not work with a GET request at least
- using burpsuite to intercept all of the traffic, we see that it does contact the page when we login
- looking at the cookie, OAuth2, we see that the Bearer is using the same exact value in base64, so using a decoder we see there is some derserialization happening on the machine
