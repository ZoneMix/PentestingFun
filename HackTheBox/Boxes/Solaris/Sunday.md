# Sunday

- we can use the pentest monkey script to enum users on fingerd
- ssh is open on 22022 so possibly can look for login after users
- we see that sunny can run /root/troll but we can't do anything with that
- within /backup there is a shadow file that has sammy's password in it
- we can take this back file and use john to crack the password as cooldude!
- once we have sammy we can use wget as root
- dumb thing is that troll is overwritten every second
- so pop 2 terminals up one as sammy and one as sunny and run both at like the same time to get root shell from sunny terminal
